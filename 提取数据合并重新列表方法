ishomestat = startsWith(vnames,"Home")


Task 4
homestats = EPL{:,ishomestat}


Task 5
isawaystat = startsWith(EPL.Properties.VariableNames,"Away")
awaystats = EPL{:,isawaystat}

Task 6
totalstats = homestats + awaystats


Task 7
v =startsWith(vnames,"Home")
hnames = vnames(:,startsWith(vnames,"Home"))  %allways use method.
hnames = vnames{:,startsWith(vnames,"Home")}  %what's the different between {} and []?

Task 8
tnames = replace(hnames, ...
    "Home","Total")


Task 9

EPL{:,tnames} = totalstats


Further Practice
myText = string(myText)

vnames = string(EPL.Properties.VariableNames)
EPL.Properties.VariableNames = vnames + "_2015"
